%help
    This is a reference container that packages reference data files
    to be used in various computational analysis pipelines.

    The container manifest is located at /payload/MANIFEST.tsv
    --- quick access manifest: ./CONTAINER.sif manifest
    If a readme is included, it is located at /payload/README.txt
    --- quick access readme: ./CONTAINER.sif readme
    All reference data files are located under /payload
    --- copy to current dir: ./CONTAINER get REF_FILE_NAME
    --- copy to path: ./CONTAINER get REF_FILE_NAME DESTINATION_PATH
    (The path prefix /payload must be omitted from REF_FILE_NAME)
